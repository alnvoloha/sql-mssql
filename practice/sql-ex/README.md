# Practice SQL tasks (by topic)

This folder contains solutions to SQL tasks grouped by **topic**.
Each file is self‑contained and usually includes the original task comment at the top.

## Topics
- `01-filtering` – WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, simple conditions
- `02-aggregation` – GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT/SUM/AVG
- `03-joins` – JOIN patterns
- `04-subqueries` – nested SELECTs, correlated subqueries
- `05-set-ops` – UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT (when used)
- `06-cte-recursion` – CTEs, recursive solutions (including number conversions)
- `07-date-time` – date/time logic
- `08-strings` – string parsing and transformation

> Some tasks can belong to more than one topic; I placed them by the *main* skill they train.
